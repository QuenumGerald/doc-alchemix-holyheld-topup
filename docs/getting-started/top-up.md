# Borrowing and Top-up Process

Learn how to borrow against your collateral and top up your Holyheld card.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the top-up process:
- Ensure you have deposited collateral
- Selected a yield strategy
- Have your HolyTag ready

## Top-up Steps

1. Navigate to the Top-up section
2. Enter your desired borrowing amount
3. Input your HolyTag
4. Review the transaction details:
   - Borrowing amount
   - Available credit
   - Estimated repayment timeline
5. Confirm the transaction

## Important Considerations

- Borrowing limits are based on your collateral value
- The loan automatically repays itself through yield generation
- Monitor your position's health regularly

## Transaction Monitoring

After initiating a top-up:
1. Wait for transaction confirmation
2. Check your Holyheld card balance
3. Track the transaction status on the blockchain
